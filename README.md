## WHiM

WHiM or Wide Hierarchical Muxer

### Background

Originally created as a hypertext muxer, WHiM has become a fork of the jigdo software which is adding capability for transferring hypertext data.

### Function

WHiM works on the underlying principle of jigdo in which multiple parts and directories are combined into one resulting file at the end. It works with HTTP data as well with an add-on/plug-in for the desired browser which interfaces with whim.dll (Linux implementation coming soon!) 

- Download Files
```whim remotefile.wif
```
- Stream HTTP Data
```whim remotedestination.wis
```
